### Introduction

The accelerometer is built using components available on the Internet. At the heart is the LIS3DH accelerometer, capable of ranges up to 16G and sample rates up to 400 Hz. Multiple accelerometers can be used, with simultaneous activation and data collection.

Included in this repository are:

- [Materials list](./MATERIALS.md)
- [Instructions for assembling accelerometers](./ASSEMBLY.md)
- [Firmware source code for the accelerometer](./firmware/)
- Server source code for capturing data
- Sample data and lesson examples

You may download the entire repository [using this link](https://github.com/jchuahtacc/AccelerometerLogger/archive/master.zip).
